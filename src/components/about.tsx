        <p>
          I'm a hustler. Every day I'm either learning something new, building
          something, or figuring out what's next. My mission is to retire my
          family, repaying them for everything they've given me, and to build a
          company that creates a lasting positive impact on humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm training or playing football. I also like to
          debate with friends about current world issues and geopolitics to
          enrich my knowledge.
