        <p>
          I'm a hustler. Every day I'm either learning something new,
          building something, or figuring out what's next. My goal is to
          build a big companyâ€”the kind that actually matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm training or playing football. I also like
          to debate with friends about current world issues and geopolitics
          to enrich my knowledge.
