        <p>
          I'm a hustler. Every day I'm either learning something new, building
          something, or figuring out what's next. My mission is to retire my
          family, repaying them for everything they've given me, and to build a
          company that creates lasting positive impact on humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm training. I've been practising karate for 7
          years and currently hold a blue belt. I also play football and enjoy
          debating current world issues and geopolitics with friends to expand
          my perspective.
